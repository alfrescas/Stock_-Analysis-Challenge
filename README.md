# Module 2: Stock Analysis Challenge

## Overview of Project:

Steve is wanting to expand the dataset to include the enitre stock market throughout the last few years. In order to provide a faster way to look at the data, the code will need to be refactored. Refactoring the code will ensure that Steve's expansion of the dataset is going to be able to run in matter of seconds. In the following analysis, I will provide the steps that I did and also diffliculties, that lead me to have more efficent code to runs Steve's extended dataset.

## Analysis:

Activating the worksheets in the refactored code, then setting the range to calculate the year values as shown below:

I got the results from the stock performance of 2017, As shown below, we can see that DQ traded 35,796,200. With a successful return rate of 200%. Based on the data of the stock performance, in 2017, DQ had a great year.

In the year 2018, we can see that DQ traded a total of 107,873,900, but with a return drop rate of 63%. The performance of 2018, was definitely not a great outcome for DQ, based on the data provided below.

## Comparisions between the Original Code and the Refactored Code:

Taking a look at the screeshots provided below, these are both outcomes of the year 2017, and the amount of time each of these outcomes ran the code.

- The first image is an example of the amount of time the code ran for the original code. As we can see the results took a lot longer compared to the second image belo

- The second image, which belongs to the code that has been refactored, is significatly faster at running the code. As shown below.

#### Time of Original Code outcome:

#### Time of Refactored Code Outcome:

## Advantages of refactoring a code:

- As provided in the images above, _Time of Original outcome_ , we can see that the time it took to run the original code was a lot slower compared to the second image, _Time of Refactored code outcome_, the advantage of having a refactored code is to have the data run a lot faster and provide efficiency. 

- Steve will be able to run the extension of his dataset in a faster way. Providing more confidence for him to run his clients data and extending that data, knowing  the refactored code can do it efficiently. 

## Disadvantages of refactoring a code:    

- Based on some of the disadvantages I had refactoring this code, I experienced having to continuously alter the orginal code and figuring out how to refactor to fit the outcome that was necessary for Steve's new data to work. This could potentially lead to having problems in the future, such as bugs. 

- Altering the original code, can be very difficult especially knowing it worked and then making a new code (refatoring it) to replace the original code. I can see there may be a disadvantage of ruining the code and having to start the coding all over. Thus extending the time it takes to implement the code.
